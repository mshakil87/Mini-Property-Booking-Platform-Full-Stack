Architecture
- Separate React apps for guests and admins for clear role-based UX.
- Laravel API with repository interfaces bound to Eloquent implementations for testability.
- Media stored on disk via Laravel storage with database records in `property_media`.
- Properties store a lightweight `images` array for fast rendering; `media` covers uploads and video.

Design Patterns
- Repository pattern isolates data access from services/controllers.
- Services encapsulate domain logic (availability checks, booking rules).
- Middleware guards admin actions with a simple role check.

Schema Choices
- `properties`: title, description, price_per_night (decimal), location, amenities (json), images (json).
- `property_media`: property_id, type (image|video), path, caption, mime_type, size.
- `availabilities`: property_id, start_date, end_date for open booking ranges.
- `bookings`: property_id, user_id, start_date, end_date, total_price, status.

Programming Approach
- Keep controllers thin; validation + delegate to services.
- Use pagination from Laravel for all listings to keep responses small.
- Favor simple, composable React pages with Tailwind utility classes.
- Frontend navigation: Ensured consistent routing by removing explicit '/admin' prefixes from internal navigation links after adjusting BrowserRouter configuration, resolving 'No routes matched' errors.

Admin UX
- Clean design: white header, bordered cards, focused forms.
- Full CRUD on properties, inline edit form, media manager with file upload, booking moderation.
- Pagination added to properties and bookings for scalability.
- Refactored property management: separated 'Add Property' and 'Edit Property' into distinct pages for better maintainability and clearer user flow.
- Implemented search and filter capabilities for both properties (by title/location and featured status) and bookings (by property title/user email and status) to improve administrative efficiency.

Frontend UX
- Catchy gradient header using Tailwind, focused content sections.
- Listings with filters and pagination; details show images (dummyimage.com) and uploaded media.
- Booking flow redirects unauthenticated users to login and back to target.

Seeding
- 100 properties with varied amenities.
- Images via `https://dummyimage.com/` to avoid missing files.
- Sample bookings for admin testing; storage symlink for uploaded media.

Tradeoffs
- Simple availability model (no overlapping checks beyond service-level rules).
- Client-side pagination controls based on Laravel paginator meta.
- No global state manager; localStorage token suffices for this scope.

Future Improvements
- Role-based routing and nav with user context.
- Image optimization and lazy loading.
- Better availability editor (merge/split ranges).
- Email notifications via queued jobs beyond logging.
