Architecture
- Separate React apps for guests and admins for clear role-based UX.
- Laravel API with repository interfaces bound to Eloquent implementations for testability.
- Media stored on disk via Laravel storage with database records in `property_media`.
- Properties store a lightweight `images` array for fast rendering; `media` covers uploads and video.

Design Patterns
- Repository pattern isolates data access from services/controllers.
- Services encapsulate domain logic (availability checks, booking rules).
- Middleware guards admin actions with a simple role check.

Schema Choices
- `properties`: title, description, price_per_night (decimal), location, amenities (json), images (json).
- `property_media`: property_id, type (image|video), path, caption, mime_type, size.
- `availabilities`: property_id, start_date, end_date for open booking ranges.
- `bookings`: property_id, user_id, start_date, end_date, total_price, status.

Programming Approach
- Keep controllers thin; validation + delegate to services.
- Use pagination from Laravel for all listings to keep responses small.
- Favor simple, composable React pages with Tailwind utility classes.
- Frontend navigation: Ensured consistent routing by removing explicit '/admin' prefixes from internal navigation links after adjusting BrowserRouter configuration, resolving 'No routes matched' errors.

Admin UX
- Clean design: white header, bordered cards, focused forms.
- Full CRUD on properties, inline edit form, media manager with file upload, booking moderation.
- Pagination added to properties and bookings for scalability.
- Refactored property management: separated 'Add Property' and 'Edit Property' into distinct pages for better maintainability and clearer user flow.
- Implemented search and filter capabilities for both properties (by title/city name and featured status) and bookings (by property title/user email and status) to improve administrative efficiency.
- Added "Clear" buttons to property listings for improved search UX, allowing users to quickly reset all active filters.
- Redesigned login page for a more professional look, with styled success/error messages and automatic redirection to the dashboard upon successful login.
- Enhanced error handling for property updates to provide more specific feedback from the API.
- Resolved "No routes matched" errors by ensuring correct router configuration and `historyApiFallback` for direct URL access.

Frontend UX
- Catchy gradient header using Tailwind, focused content sections.
- Listings with filters and pagination; details show images (dummyimage.com) and uploaded media.
- Booking flow redirects unauthenticated users to login and back to target.
- Added "Change Password" page for guest users, providing a secure way to update credentials from the frontend dashboard.
- Improved search UX with a "Clear Filters" button to reset multiple search parameters instantly.
- Removed date picker from property details page to streamline the booking process.
- Confirmed existing image slider/gallery functionality with auto-start and full-size image pop-up on click.

Seeding
- 100 properties with varied amenities.
- Images via `https://dummyimage.com/` to avoid missing files.
- Sample bookings for admin testing; storage symlink for uploaded media.

Tradeoffs
- Simple availability model (no overlapping checks beyond service-level rules).
- Client-side pagination controls based on Laravel paginator meta.
- Tiered API Rate Limiting: Grouped routes into `auth`, `public`, and `private` throttle categories in `AppServiceProvider` and `api.php` to protect against brute-force and abuse while maintaining UX for standard users.
- Boolean Filter Normalization: Fixed a bug where string-based query parameters (e.g., `?is_featured=true`) were failing database comparisons by using `filter_var(..., FILTER_VALIDATE_BOOLEAN)` in the repository layer.
- No global state manager; localStorage token suffices for this scope.

Troubleshooting
- **Direct URL Access (404 errors in development/preview):** If encountering 404 errors when directly accessing routes (e.g., `/properties`, `/bookings`) in the frontend or admin panel development/preview environments, ensure `historyApiFallback: true` is configured in `vite.config.ts` for the `preview` server. This allows client-side routing to handle non-static asset requests.

Future Improvements
- Role-based routing and nav with user context.
- Image optimization and lazy loading.
- Better availability editor (merge/split ranges).
- Email notifications via queued jobs beyond logging.
